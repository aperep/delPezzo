Main functionalities:
The Surface class is used to represent a surface in algebraic geometry. It takes a degree as input and constructs the surface by performing blowups and creating exceptional curves. It also has a Line method that calculates a line bundle on the surface.

Methods:
- __init__: initializes the Surface object by performing blowups and creating exceptional curves
- Line: calculates a line bundle on the surface

Fields:
- degree: the degree of the surface
- N: the toric lattice of the surface
- K: the canonical divisor of the surface
- E: the set of exceptional curves on the surface
