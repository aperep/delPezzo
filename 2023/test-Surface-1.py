Code Analysis

Main functionalities:
The Surface class represents a surface in algebraic geometry, defined by its degree and a possible extra parameter. It initializes the surface by computing its canonical divisor, exceptional curves, and a ToricLattice. It also provides a Line method that takes a list of exceptional curves and returns a new point on the surface.

Methods:
- __init__(self, degree:int, extra=None) -> None: initializes the Surface object by computing its canonical divisor, exceptional curves, and a ToricLattice.
- Line(self, exceptional_curves:list): takes a list of exceptional curves and returns a new point on the surface.

Fields:
- degree: an integer representing the degree of the surface.
- N: a ToricLattice object representing the ToricLattice of the surface.
- K: a vector representing the canonical divisor of the surface.
- E: a list of vectors representing the exceptional curves of the surface.
